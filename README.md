# griffinsLora for Automation.art
This board is a connection of ESP32 + quality Lora module in a minimalistic design. You can use this board as a data transmission system circuit or as a separate sensor transmitting data over a long distance 

#### Right away about bugs that were fixed in the scheme after the first prototype) 
!Everything works at once

###  How does it work?
There is no final functionality yet, but you can realize all your ideas. In the code examples you can find receiving and transmitting Lora messages, as well as displaying them on the screen (optional). All libraries have been added.

### Main features
- One-piece board without wires
- Microcontroller with antenna
- Mounting holes
- 2 indicator LEDs
- Connection of i2c sensors (e.g. OLED 1.3)
- Uart programming
- JTAG pins
- Connection of an external contact or button (pins out)
- Ldo 3.3v
- Power switch
- WiFi/Ble

### Examples of use
- Radio - messenger (Meshtastic?).
- Sensor data acquisition
- Monitoring data on the display
- Lora transmitter for data / Receiver
- Crazy amount of ideas
